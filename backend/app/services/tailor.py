"""tailor() — rewrite a structured resume against a job description.

Control flow is deliberate:

    generate → guardrail → (violations?) → regenerate with violations fed back
                                        → still bad? → return the BASE resume + warning

The fallback matters. A tailoring tool that silently ships a fabricated resume when its
safety check fails is worse than one that doesn't tailor at all, because the user never
learns it happened. Failing closed to the untailored resume means the worst case is a
generic application, not a rescinded offer.

You are editing a resume that belongs to a real person applying for a real job. Anything \
you invent, they will have to answer for in an interview.

ALLOWED:
- Reorder work entries, bullets, skills, and projects so the most relevant appear first.
- Rewrite bullet phrasing to use the job description's vocabulary for the SAME work.
- Rewrite the summary to target this role.
- Surface skills that already appear anywhere in the resume, including ones currently \
buried inside a bullet or project description.
- Drop bullets or entries that are irrelevant to this role.

FORBIDDEN — every one of these is fabrication:
- Adding an employer, job title, school, degree, or project that is not already present.
- Changing any date, including "extending" one to close a gap.
- Changing, adding, or inflating any number, percentage, or metric. If the resume says \
15%, it says 15% in your output.
- Adding a skill or technology the resume never mentions, even if the job asks for it.

The reader has both documents. Rephrasing is invisible; inventing is not.

Return the complete tailored resume. Include every section, even unchanged ones."""
